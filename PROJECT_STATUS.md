- [x] Filter words by source (Quranic/User/Both)
- [x] Word statistics dashboard

### Quiz System
- [x] Generate random quiz questions
- [x] Support multiple choice answers
- [x] Two question types:
  - Arabic to English translation
  - English to Arabic translation
- [x] Track quiz performance
- [x] Immediate feedback on answers

### Notification System
- [x] Configurable quiz notifications
- [x] Interactive notifications with answer options
- [x] Customizable active hours
- [x] Adjustable notification frequency
- [x] Test mode for instant notifications
- [x] Feedback notifications for correct/incorrect answers

## Technical Implementation

### Database
- Room Database for local storage
- Word entity with fields:
  - Arabic word
  - English meaning
  - Transliteration
  - Root word
  - Context
  - Source (quranic/user)

### Architecture Components
- MVVM Architecture
- ViewModel for UI logic
- Repository pattern for data management
- Kotlin Coroutines for async operations
- StateFlow for reactive UI updates
- WorkManager for notification scheduling
- DataStore for settings persistence

### UI Components
- Jetpack Compose for modern UI
- Material3 design system
- Custom components:
  - TimePickerDialog
  - TimeSelector
  - QuizNotification layout
  - Word selection interface

### Settings & Preferences
- Notification toggle
- Quiz source selection
- Active hours configuration
- Notification frequency adjustment
- Test mode for debugging

## Data Sources
- Preloaded Quranic words from JSON
- User-added custom words
- Word context information
- Root word tracking

## Current Development Status
- Core functionality implemented and stable
- Quiz notification system working reliably
- Settings management complete and tested
- UI implementation finished and responsive
- Minimum viable product (MVP) achieved

## Planned Improvements
- [ ] Add notification history tracking
- [ ] Implement quiz performance analytics
- [ ] Add word difficulty progression
- [ ] Create backup/restore functionality
- [ ] Add multi-language support
- [ ] Implement widget for quick access

## Code Stability Recommendations

### Version Control
1. **Git Implementation**
   - Initialize Git repository if not done
   - Create .gitignore for Android project
   - Make initial commit of stable version

### Code Organization
1. **Package Structure**
   - Maintain current MVVM architecture
   - Keep feature-based package organization
   - Document package dependencies

2. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Add unit tests for critical components:
     - QuizScheduler
     - NotificationManager
     - QuizWorker
   - Implement UI tests for settings screens

### Documentation
1. **Code Documentation**
   - Add KDoc comments to key classes
   - Document complex WorkManager implementations
   - Create architecture diagram

2. **Build Process**
   - Document build configurations
   - List all dependencies with versions
   - Create setup guide for new developers

### Stability Measures
1. **Error Handling**
   - Add comprehensive error logging
   - Implement crash reporting
   - Create recovery mechanisms

2. **State Management**
   - Document app state flows
   - Implement state restoration
   - Add data backup strategy

### Future Development Guidelines
1. **Feature Branches**
   - Create branches for new features
   - Implement PR review process
   - Maintain change log

2. **Testing Protocol**
   - Test new features in isolation
   - Verify notification system after changes
   - Run regression tests

3. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Monitor WorkManager operations
   - Track notification delivery
   - Measure app performance metrics

## Known Issues
1. ~~Notification scheduling unreliable~~ (Fixed)
2. ~~Missing immediate feedback~~ (Fixed)
3. ~~Sub-15-minute intervals not working~~ (Fixed)

## Recent Updates
1. Enhanced notification system reliability:
   - Implemented immediate feedback when changing quiz frequency
   - Added 5-second delay between confirmation and first quiz
   - Fixed recurring notifications for all intervals (1+ minutes)
   - Optimized WorkManager implementation for short intervals
2. Improved user feedback:
   - Added confirmation messages for frequency changes
   - Implemented immediate quiz after frequency selection
   - Enhanced notification visibility and persistence
3. Fixed core functionality:
   - Resolved notification scheduling issues
   - Implemented reliable periodic notifications
   - Added support for sub-15-minute intervals

## Testing Status
- Basic functionality tested
- Notification system verified
- Settings persistence confirmed
- Long-term reliability monitoring ongoing

## Technical Dependencies
- Kotlin Coroutines: Async operations
- WorkManager: Notification scheduling
- DataStore: Settings persistence
- Material3: UI components
- Room: Local database
- AndroidX: Core components
